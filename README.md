## How to play
With left click you put the pion in your hand, with your right click, you put the pion on the board.
## Description
I like play to board games, such as chess or checkers. This game was made in the most part, in NSI class with all knowledge that I know use.
The code can be long and language not the better for this but it's for doing a funny thing, not a commercial.
